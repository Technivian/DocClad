# CMS Aegis Project Status

Last updated: 2026-04-25

Current checkout: `main` at `0262a2a` (`Automate release evidence bundle`)

## Executive Snapshot

CMS Aegis is a multi-tenant Django CLM / legal operations platform with contract lifecycle management, workflow routing, clause governance, privacy/compliance tooling, e-signature handling, search, reporting, and a broad set of admin/integration surfaces.

The app is **demo-ready** and **internally MVP-ready** for a CLM pilot. The current checkout can be taken to a `GO` release-gate state by running the synthetic Sprint 3 evidence seed + release evidence bundle command. The remaining production gap is live integration proof and rollback / restore evidence, not basic code correctness.

## UI Design Unification Status (Phase 2)

Latest pass: 2026-05-18 (Classification-only mapping pass)

Classification artifact:

- `DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md`

Classification coverage:

- Templates scanned: 123
- UI routes classified: 190
- Recommended archetype totals:
  - QueuePage: 28
  - WorkspacePage: 20
  - CommandPage: 32
  - NetworkPage: 16
  - ExceptionPage: 19
  - Unknown / Needs decision: 8

Classification-only outcomes:

- Complete template-level planning matrix now exists with: current archetype, recommended archetype, confidence, drift notes, migration priority/risk, and dependencies.
- Major named UI routes now have recommended archetype mapping for migration planning.
- Top migration candidates and recommended Batch 3 scope are explicitly documented.

Classification pass risk level:

- None (no runtime template changes were made)

Previous migration batch: 2026-05-18 (Batch 1)

Migrated files:

- `theme/templates/contracts/contract_list.html`
- `theme/templates/contracts/risk_log_list.html`
- `theme/templates/contracts/budget_list.html`
- `theme/templates/contracts/trademark_request_list.html`

Batch outcomes:

- Canonical page headers applied (`page-wrap`, `page-header`, `page-title`, `page-subtitle`).
- Canonical form-field primitives maintained (`form-input`, `form-select`).
- Canonical table surface + row patterns applied (`panel`, `tbl-*`, removal of inline row hover handlers).
- Canonical status badge primitives applied (`badge-sm` + semantic badge variants).

Remaining inconsistent areas:

- Multiple list/detail templates still use ad-hoc status pills and non-canonical table wrappers.
- Some pages still use custom header structures and mixed spacing rhythm.
- `contracts/forms.py` still contains hardcoded utility class constants pending canonical form primitive migration.

Visual-risk level (latest batch):

- Low-to-medium
- Rationale: no business logic changes, no new visual styles, and no architecture changes; only primitive consolidation.

Pattern-first update (2026-05-18):

- Canonical page archetypes defined in `DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_PATTERNS.md`.
- Reusable wrappers/examples added in `theme/templates/patterns/archetype_wrappers_examples.html`.

Batch 2 migrated files (QueuePage archetype):

- `theme/templates/contracts/client_list.html`
- `theme/templates/contracts/matter_list.html`
- `theme/templates/contracts/document_list.html`

Batch 2 outcomes:

- Queue pages now follow canonical header, filter, table, badge, and spacing behavior.
- Business logic, data behavior, and routes preserved.

Batch 2 visual-risk level:

- Low-to-medium
- Rationale: strict archetype/pattern migration without introducing new visual systems or one-off designs.

Batch 3 pre-migration planning (2026-05-18):

- Strict execution checklist created before any template edits begin.
- Full per-template analysis completed for all 8 Batch 3 candidates.
- Artifact: `BATCH3_WORKSPACE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Status: Planning only — no templates modified.

Batch 3 Slice 1 migration (2026-05-18):

- Canonical `badge-sm` + semantic badge variants applied to all status/priority indicators.
- Canonical `btn-primary-grad`, `btn-ghost` applied to all action buttons.
- `aria-label` added to form action buttons and icon-only indicators; `aria-hidden` on decorative SVGs; `role="region"` on drill command block.
- `overflow-x-auto` table wrapper added for mobile safety.
- Zero business logic changes. Zero inline event handlers introduced. Zero routing changes.

- `theme/templates/base.html` (removed `.action-chip` CSS block — class fully retired)

Batch 3 Slice 2 Step 1 outcomes:

- `action-chip` is now fully retired from the design system. Zero references remain in any template.
- 3 × `action-chip` CTAs replaced with `btn-ghost` in dashboard.html page-actions.

- `bg-teal-600` hardcoded primary CTA replaced with `btn-primary-grad`.
- Raw secondary buttons/links replaced with `btn-ghost`.
- Inline `onclick="toggleFilters()"` removed; replaced with `addEventListener` in script block; `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` added.
- Filter panel: raw bg/border → `panel` + `panel-inner`; labels → `form-label`.
- Table: `panel overflow-hidden`, `tbl-head`, `tbl-th`, `tbl-row`, `tbl-td`.
- Status dots: raw rounded divs → `status-dot [green/blue/yellow/gray]`.

- Pagination links → `btn-ghost`.
- Decorative SVG → `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Django check: 0 issues. Template parse: OK. Test suite: 3/3 passed. 0 inline violations.

Batch 3 Slice 2 Step 3 migration (2026-05-18):

Files changed:
- `theme/templates/contracts/repository.html` — WorkspacePage normalization; inline handler removal

Batch 3 Slice 2 Step 3 outcomes:
- Template parse: OK
- manage.py check: 0 issues
- manage.py test contracts: 3/3 passed
- Inline handler/style scan: 0 violations
- Retired/ad-hoc class scan: 0 remaining

Batch 3 Slice 2 Step 4 migration (2026-05-18):

- manage.py test contracts: 3/3 passed
- Inline handler/style scan: 0 violations
- Retired/ad-hoc class scan: 0 remaining
- Board CSS verified in base.html: all 5 rules present

Remaining accessibility gap: drag-and-drop column movement not keyboard accessible (not faked). Only "Complete" (→ DONE) transition is keyboard reachable. Full column movement documented for Batch 4.

**Batch 3 Complete — all 8 templates migrated.**

Batch 3 targets (8 templates, 1,158 total lines):
- WorkspacePage: dashboard.html, workflow_dashboard.html, repository.html, privacy_dashboard.html, legal_task_board.html ✅
- ExceptionPage: operations_dashboard.html, deadline_list.html, notification_list.html ✅

Expected UX impact if Batch 3 succeeds:
- Visual coherence across top 5 highest-traffic workspace surfaces.
- 25% of all WorkspacePage templates (5 of 20) on canonical primitive system.
- Inline event handler violations eliminated from 2 pages.
- Accessibility baseline improved (ARIA roles, aria-label, aria-hidden on icons).
- Token-backed primitives replacing hardcoded utility stacks on 4 fully-raw templates.

### Backend apps and modules

The codebase is centered on the `contracts` Django app:

- `contracts/models.py`
- `contracts/forms.py`
- `contracts/permissions.py`
- `contracts/middleware.py`
- `contracts/api/views.py`
- `contracts/views.py`
- `contracts/views_domains/*`
- `contracts/services/*`
- `contracts/management/commands/*`
- `contracts/domain/*`
- `config/settings_base.py`
- `config/urls.py`

### Database entities

The main persisted models are:

- Organization / membership / invitation / user profile
- SCIM groups and API tokens
- Salesforce connection / field map / sync run
- Webhook endpoint / delivery
- Executive dashboard preset / search preset
- Client / matter / contract / document / OCR review
- Time entry / invoice / trust account / trust transaction
- Deadline / audit log / notification
- Conflict check / trademark request / legal task / tag / risk log
- Compliance checklist / checklist item
- Workflow template / workflow template step / workflow / workflow step
- Due diligence process / task / risk
- Budget / budget expense
- Negotiation thread
- Counterparty
- Clause category / clause template / clause playbook / clause variant
- Ethical wall
- Signature request
- Data inventory / DSAR / subprocessor / transfer record / retention policy / legal hold
- Approval rule / approval request
- Background job

### APIs and integrations

The app currently includes:

- SCIM provisioning APIs
- SAML login / ACS / logout / metadata
- Salesforce OAuth, status, sync, and sync-run APIs
- NetSuite sync API / command
- E-sign webhook reconciliation API
- Webhook delivery APIs
- Executive analytics APIs
- API v1 contract endpoints
- Legacy contract APIs
- AI assistant contract endpoint
- Background job and evidence bundle commands

## What Works

- Tenant-scoped login / register / logout flows
- Dashboard and main navigation
- Contract create / edit / list / detail
- Clause library create / edit / compare / version history
- Workflow templates and workflow execution
- Signature requests and transition guardrails
- Privacy/compliance pages and records
- Search, semantic search, and saved search presets
- Reporting / executive dashboards / exports
- Client, matter, document, billing, trust, risk, compliance, due diligence, trademark, and ethical wall flows
- Focused Django test suites pass locally
- `manage.py check` passes
- `manage.py migrate --noinput` passes on the current checkout
- `manage.py audit_null_organizations` passes after migrations
- `manage.py generate_release_evidence_bundle` generates a full release evidence pack and reports `GO` when Sprint 3 evidence is seeded

## What Is Partial

- SAML and SCIM are implemented, but external IdP / lifecycle proof is still a deployment concern
- Salesforce, NetSuite, and e-sign integrations exist, but live end-to-end evidence is still the real gate
- Some UI shells and demo templates are still experimental
- Some features are strong enough for internal use but still need enterprise polish and production hardening

## What Is Broken Or Missing

- The repo currently has a moderate `postcss` vulnerability reported by `npm audit`
- `theme/templates/contracts/templates_list.html` still contains placeholder TODO actions for edit/use-template behavior
- `contracts/services/repository.py` still retains a mock service path and abstract interface
- Production proof is not complete without a backup / restore rehearsal and real live cutover evidence
- Live Salesforce / webhook evidence from the target environment is still needed for true rollout confidence

## Current Risks

- Large, high-complexity modules are still easy to regress
- Integrations depend on external systems and live credentials
- Release confidence depends on evidence, not just code passing locally
- The UI contains some experimental/demonstration shells that can confuse scope
- Frontend dependency audit has a moderate PostCSS issue

## Recommendation

Treat the app as:

- **Demo-ready:** yes
- **Internal MVP-ready:** yes, with scope discipline
- **Production-ready:** not yet for a live rollout, because production cutover proof and live integration evidence are still missing

## Next Recommended Actions

1. Capture live Salesforce sync evidence in the target org.
2. Capture webhook delivery evidence from a real endpoint.
3. Finish the backup / restore rehearsal on the real database target.
4. Remove or resolve the remaining frontend TODO actions.
5. Address the moderate PostCSS advisory.
6. Consolidate experimental UI shells and demo templates.
7. Keep release evidence bundle commands attached to the release workflow.
8. Add stronger live E2E coverage for the major user flows.

## Batch 3 Post-Migration Audit (2026-05-18)

**Verdict: PASS**

All 8 Batch 3 templates passed the post-migration audit. Full report: `BATCH3_POST_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`.

### Audit Fixes Applied

| Fix | File | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `input-field` × 3 → `input-base` / `select-base` | workflow_dashboard.html | Pre-existing violation fixed |
| `text-red-500` → `c-danger` on legal-hold KPI | privacy_dashboard.html | Minor canonical substitution |
| `text-red-500` → `c-danger` on job error text | operations_dashboard.html | Minor canonical substitution |

### Remaining Documented Exceptions

| Exception | Template | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-blue-50` unread row tint | notification_list.html | Token gap — needs `--row-unread-bg` in Batch 4 |
| `bg-red-50` overdue row tint | deadline_list.html | Token gap — needs `--row-overdue-bg` in Batch 4 |
| Drag-and-drop keyboard column movement | legal_task_board.html | ARIA gap — deferred to Batch 4 JS work |

### Batch 3 Final State

- 8/8 templates archived as MIGRATED in DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md
- 0 inline handlers remaining
- 0 inline styles remaining
- 0 retired classes remaining
- 0 undefined primitive classes remaining
- Template parse: 8/8 OK
- manage.py check: 0 issues
- manage.py test contracts: 3/3 passed

## Batch 4 Step 1 — Row-State Token Debt Cleanup (2026-05-18)

**Scope:** Token definition and 2 template replacements. No page migration.

### Tokens Added to base.html

| Token | Dark value | Light value |
|---|---|---|
| `--row-unread-bg` | `rgba(37,99,235,0.08)` | `#EFF6FF` |
| `--row-overdue-bg` | `rgba(239,68,68,0.08)` | `#FEF2F2` |

### Classes Added to base.html

| Class | CSS |
|---|---|
| `.row-unread` | `background: var(--row-unread-bg)` |
| `.row-overdue` | `background: var(--row-overdue-bg)` |

### Raw Utility Exceptions Resolved

| Was | Now | Template |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-blue-50` | `row-unread` | `notification_list.html` |
| `bg-red-50` | `row-overdue` | `deadline_list.html` |

### Remaining Raw Color Usages (Intentional — Not Row-State)

The following `bg-blue-50` / `bg-red-50` usages in templates are decorative panel/button/banner colors — not row-state — and are explicitly NOT replaced by this cleanup:

- `profile.html` — info/warning card banners
- `workflow_template_detail.html` — step card hover + info banner
- `workflow_detail.html` — current-step panel tint
- `contract_form.html` — drag handle and button hover colors
- `signature_request_detail.html` — status banners and action buttons
- `organization_team.html` — inline team action buttons
- `clause_template_detail.html` — selected version card highlight
- `workflow_form.html` — info banner
- JS strings in `obligations_list.html`, `clause_library.html`, `templates_list.html`, `reports_dashboard.html` — toast/chart colors

### Validation

- manage.py check: 0 issues
- Template parse: notification_list.html OK, deadline_list.html OK
- Tests: 3/3 passed

**Batch 4 page migration wave (reports_dashboard.html, identity_telemetry_dashboard.html, contract_detail.html, contract_list.html, search_results.html) can now begin.**

## Batch 4 Step 2 Slice A — Dashboard Migration (2026-05-18)

**Status: ✅ Complete**

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `theme/templates/contracts/reports_dashboard.html` | Full WorkspacePage migration |
| `theme/templates/contracts/identity_telemetry_dashboard.html` | Full WorkspacePage migration |
| `DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md` | Both templates marked MIGRATED |
| `DESIGN_UNIFICATION_ROADMAP.md` | Slice A log entry added |

### Primitives Normalized

**reports_dashboard.html:** `page-wrap`, `page-header`, `page-title`, `page-subtitle`, `page-actions`, `dash-grid dash-grid-4` (×2), `kpi-card`, `stat-card-amber`, `stat-card-red`, `panel`, `panel-head`, `panel-inner`, `panel-divider`, `dash-grid dash-grid-2`, `list-row`, `btn-ghost`, `c-muted`, `c-danger`, `c-success-soft`, `report-progress-track/fill`, chart ARIA roles

**identity_telemetry_dashboard.html:** `page-wrap`, `page-header`, `page-title`, `page-subtitle`, `page-actions`, `dash-grid dash-grid-4`, `kpi-card`, `panel`, `panel-head`, `panel-inner`, `tbl-head`, `tbl-th`, `tbl-row`, `list-row`, `btn-ghost`, `c-muted`

### Remaining Risks

- 2 inline `style=` color overrides for amber (A/R) and blue (upcoming deadlines) — no canonical c-warning/c-info token yet; flagged for Step 3 token cleanup
- Chart bars use Tailwind `bg-blue-500` / `bg-red-500` in JS strings — acceptable; chart internals are JS-controlled and not template structure

### Slice B Readiness

✅ **Slice B can begin** — contract_detail.html and contract_list.html are next candidates per DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md.

---

## Batch 4 Step 3 — Slice A Token Cleanup (2026-05-18)

**Status: ✅ Complete**

### Files Changed

### Token Summary

- `c-warning` — amber-500 (`#F59E0B`), for financial attention/warning values
- `c-info` — blue-400 (`#60A5FA`), for informational/upcoming indicators

### Inline Style Debt: reports_dashboard.html

- Before: 2 inline `style="color:..."` overrides
- After: 0 — fully resolved

### Slice B Readiness

✅ **Slice B can begin** — `contract_detail.html` is the next candidate.

---

## Batch 4 Step 4 — Slice B: contract_list.html QueuePage Migration

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Changes

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `theme/templates/contracts/contract_list.html` | Removed `contracts-list-page` class; added `page-actions` wrapper; `aria-hidden="true"` on all decorative SVGs |
| `DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md` | `contract_list.html` marked MIGRATED |
| `DESIGN_UNIFICATION_ROADMAP.md` | Step 4 Slice B log entry added |

### Intentional Exceptions (Documented)

- `pre#ai-assistant-output` — raw `bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200` (no canonical code-output primitive)
- Negotiation notes list — raw `divide-y`/`px-5 py-3` vertical stack (no canonical vertical list-item primitive)
- Grid wrappers — Tailwind responsive `lg:grid-cols-3/2` (dash-grid has no responsive breakpoints)

---

## Batch 5 Step 3 — c-success Token Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-18)

Added `c-success` (`#16A34A`) to base.html. Replaced 2 `text-green-600` raw utility uses in invoice_list.html and invoice_detail.html. Documented in DESIGN_CONSTITUTION.md §12. All exceptions from Batch 5 Step 2 now resolved.

**Next:** retention_policy page wave

---

## Batch 5 Step 4 — Retention Policy Page Wave ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-18)

### Next: organization/settings templates wave

---

## Batch 5 Step 5 — Org/Settings Discovery ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-18)

### Templates Discovered

7 organization/settings/profile templates found and classified:

| Template | Archetype | Risk | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `settings_hub.html` | WorkspacePage | LOW | Slice A |
| `organization_security_settings.html` | WorkspacePage | LOW-MEDIUM | Slice A |
| `organization_session_audit.html` | QueuePage | LOW-MEDIUM | Slice A |
| `organization_identity_settings.html` | WorkspacePage | MEDIUM | Slice A |
| `organization_activity.html` | QueuePage | MEDIUM | Slice B |
| `organization_team.html` | WorkspacePage | HIGH | Slice B — defer |
| `profile.html` | WorkspacePage | HIGH | Defer indefinitely |

### Key Finding: Undefined Class Gap

3 classes used in settings templates are NOT defined in base.html:
- `btn-primary` → `btn-primary-grad`
- `btn-secondary` → `btn-ghost`
- `ds-badge` → `badge-sm`
- `checkbox-primary` → remove

These will be resolved in Slice A (template-side only; no new CSS needed).

### Archetype Map Corrections Applied

All 7 templates reclassified in `DESIGN_ARCHETYPE_MAP.md` with corrected archetypes.

### Next: Batch 5 Step 6 — Org/Settings Slice A Migration (4 templates)

---

| `organization_session_audit.html` | QueuePage | `page-container`→`page-wrap`, raw border div→`panel-item`, `btn-secondary`→`btn-ghost` |
| `organization_identity_settings.html` | WorkspacePage | `btn-primary`→`btn-primary-grad`, `btn-secondary`→`btn-ghost` (×2) |

### Undefined Class Gap Resolved

All 4 undefined classes in settings templates eliminated:
- `btn-primary` → `btn-primary-grad` ✅
- `btn-secondary` → `btn-ghost` ✅
- `ds-badge` → `badge-sm` ✅

All forms, routes, context variables, CSRF tokens untouched.

### Remaining Org/Settings Scope

- Slice B: `organization_activity.html` (MEDIUM), `organization_team.html` (HIGH)
- Deferred: `profile.html` (HIGH, MFA-critical)

**Tests:** 3/3 ✅ | **manage.py check:** 0 ✅ | **Legacy class scan:** clean (0 btn-primary/secondary/outline, 0 action-chip, 0 panel+stat-card)

### Recommended Batch 7 Scope
1. JS prototype refactor: obligations_list.html, templates_list.html
2. Full structural migration: remaining WorkspacePage detail pages + CommandPage forms + ExceptionPage clusters
3. legal_task_board.html (BoardView/Kanban primitive — documented, complex)
4. Auth/security surfaces if ever in scope: registration/*, profile, saml_select

**🏁 Batch 6 CLOSED.**

## Batch 7 Step 2 — Dead Prototype Retirement (2026-05-19)

**Status:** ✅ RETIRED  

### Files Deleted
- `contracts/obligations_list.html` — dead JS prototype, no route, no model, never reachable
- `contracts/templates_list.html` — dead JS prototype, URL name already resolves to canonical `workflow_template_list.html`

### Validation
- manage.py check: 0 issues ✅
- Tests: 3/3 passed ✅
- Both files confirmed TemplateDoesNotExist ✅
- No references remaining ✅

### Remaining Batch 7 Scope
- Full structural migration: remaining WorkspacePage detail pages + CommandPage forms + ExceptionPage clusters (~30 templates)
- `legal_task_board.html` — BoardView/Kanban (complex, documented primitive)
- Auth/security surfaces: out of scope (CLASS E)

**JS prototype debt cleared. Archetype map truthful.**
