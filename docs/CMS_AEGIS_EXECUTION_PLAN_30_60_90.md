# CMS Aegis CMS Aegis Execution Plan (30/60/90)

## Current North-Star Plan (Captured 2026-05-16)

The original 2026-04-12 plan has mostly been executed through the security, tenancy, workflow, and release-evidence hardening layers. What remains now is not core product invention; it is production proof, release-gate completion, and enterprise polish.

### Current Maturity Read

- Core CLM product: strong and usable.
- Identity / tenancy / RBAC: strong, with live IdP/SCIM proof still needed.
- Workflow / clause / privacy / reporting: strong to good, with targeted UX and evidence gaps.
- Integrations: partial, because live target-environment evidence is still missing.
- Production readiness: partial, because rollback / restore / cutover proof is not yet complete.

### Current 30/60/90 Focus

| Window | Primary Goal | Main Deliverables | Exit Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Next 30 days | Close release gates | Finish SPR3-001, SPR3-002, SPR3-003; capture live Salesforce/webhook evidence; attach target-env Postgres cutover evidence | Release candidate can be evaluated with real evidence, not just synthetic proof |
| Next 60 days | Lock in operational trust | Complete rollback / restore rehearsal, finish live NetSuite and e-sign validation, remove placeholder template actions, consolidate UI shells | Production change confidence is repeatable and supportable |
| Next 90 days | Reach north-star maturity | Improve commercial/support surfaces, strengthen observability and compliance packaging, complete any remaining enterprise polish | The platform is production-complete in both function and operations |

### What Still Keeps This Below 100%

1. Live integration evidence for Salesforce, webhook, NetSuite, and e-sign.
2. Staging/target-environment cutover and rollback proof with artifacts.
3. UI consolidation and removal of placeholder/demo behaviors.
4. Commercial readiness work such as onboarding, billing, and support surfaces.
5. Stronger release discipline around repeatable evidence capture.

## Baseline Snapshot (captured 2026-04-12)

Evidence from current workspace:

- Test status: `154` tests passing (`python manage.py test contracts tests -v 1`).
- Deploy checks: production profile can pass in CI, but local default profile still emits 6 deploy warnings when run in dev defaults.
- Tenancy/RBAC posture: strong route-level isolation coverage and explicit role checks.
- DB posture: base config is SQLite-only in settings.
- API hardening gaps:
  - CSRF disabled on bulk API endpoint.
  - bulk update path allows unrestricted `queryset.update(**updates)`.
  - API returns raw exception text in JSON.
- Service maturity gaps:
  - template/clause/obligation services are in-memory and mock-first.
- Security posture:
  - `npm audit` shows high vulnerabilities in both `client` and `theme/static_src`.
  - `bandit` reported no high findings, but low/medium findings remain.
- Runtime parity gap:
  - local venv is Python `3.15.0a6` while CI runs Python `3.12`.

## Progress Update (captured 2026-04-18)

Recent delivery on branch `codex/cms-aegis-activation` closed the planned Salesforce integration and several reliability/security gaps:

- `9a7d79e`: Sprint 1 Salesforce foundation + control evidence baseline.
- `90d71e6`: token encryption-at-rest + Sprint 2 ingestion/reconciliation.
- `e7dd795`: live Salesforce sync adapter (API + command).
- `8fb53dd`: sync run tracking + sync history API.
- `66b8214`: scheduled sync workflow, overlap lock, retry/dead-letter, settings UI status panel.
- `4a69022`: high-priority closure pass (CVE pin upgrades, Postgres cutover verification workflow, observability sink option, webhook queue/retry/DLQ diagnostics, NetSuite ingest baseline).

Current status against major gates:

- Day-30 critical security/integrity: functionally complete, now in evidence consolidation mode.
- Day-60 reliability/CLM depth: in progress, with observability/sync/retry foundations now shipped.
- Day-90 scale/governance: partially complete; production load-signoff and full compliance export hardening remain.
