2026-04-13:
- Completed validation for bulk API hardening (`ICL-001`) in current tree.
- Verified focused test suites pass:
  - `tests.test_cms_aegis_features` (8 tests)
  - `tests.test_security_guardrails` + `tests.test_cross_tenant_mutation_guardrails` (5 tests)
- Verified export/download permissions currently covered for organization activity export:
  - `tests.test_organization_invitations` (27 tests), including owner/admin allow, member deny, anonymous redirect, and tenant scoping checks.
- Implemented `ICL-002` configuration layer:
  - `DATABASE_URL` parsing in base settings with Postgres/SQLite support.
  - production guard now fails fast unless DB engine is PostgreSQL (or explicit emergency override).
  - updated `.env.example`, `README_CMS_AEGIS.md`, and `docs/ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md` with Postgres contract and rehearsal template.
- Validation results:
  - `python manage.py check` (development profile) passes.
  - production profile without `DATABASE_URL` correctly fails with `ImproperlyConfigured`.
  - full production-profile startup with PostgreSQL DSN is blocked in this local venv because `psycopg2-binary==2.9.10` cannot build on the current local Python `3.15.0a6` runtime.
- Next execution target: install production runtime deps in this environment, run staging-style Postgres rehearsal commands, and record evidence in `docs/DRILL_LOG.md`.
- Implemented `ICL-004` runtime alignment:
  - replaced project `.venv` with Python `3.12.13` via `uv`.
  - added repo Python pin file: `.python-version`.
  - added reproducible bootstrap script: `scripts/bootstrap_python312.sh`.
  - fixed local dev dependency gap by adding `django-debug-toolbar` to `requirements/dev.txt`.
  - added `Pillow` to runtime requirements so Django checks pass on clean envs.
  - updated CI scanner commands to improve reliability and signal quality:
    - `pip-audit --disable-pip --no-deps -r requirements/runtime.txt`
    - `bandit -q -r contracts config -lll` (high-severity gate)
- Validation evidence (2026-04-13):
  - `.venv` now runs `Python 3.12.13`.
  - `python manage.py check` passes on the new env.
  - `pip-audit --disable-pip --no-deps -r requirements/runtime.txt` reports no known vulnerabilities.
  - `bandit -q -r contracts config -lll` passes (no high-severity findings).
  - focused regression tests pass: `tests.test_cms_aegis_features` + `tests.test_security_guardrails`.
- Completed `ICL-003` dependency vulnerability verification for Node stacks:
  - `npm --prefix client audit --audit-level=high --json` reports zero high/critical vulnerabilities.
  - `npm --prefix theme/static_src audit --audit-level=high --json` reports zero high/critical vulnerabilities.
  - current package locks are already in a compliant state for the high-severity gate.
- Added staging execution artifact for `ICL-002` completion:
  - `docs/STAGING_POSTGRES_REHEARSAL.md` with exact commands, expected outputs, and `DRILL_LOG` template.
- Executed `ICL-002` staging-style rehearsal on PostgreSQL and captured evidence:
  - full backup -> migrate -> tenant checks -> restore -> post-restore checks cycle completed.

- Implemented `ICL-008` observability slice (scheduler heartbeat):
  - added heartbeat metric persistence for reminder scheduler success runs.
  - extended `/_health/` with JSON mode (`?format=json`) including scheduler stale/healthy/unknown status.
  - added regression tests in `tests/test_observability_guardrails.py`.
  - verification: `python manage.py test tests.test_observability_guardrails`.
- Implemented `ICL-009` release evidence gate (PR-level):
  - added a required PR checklist validation job in `.github/workflows/platform-guardrails.yml`.
  - updated `.github/pull_request_template.md` to capture smoke and rollback evidence fields.

  - added repeatable core route latency profiler command (`manage.py profile_core_routes`) and generated baseline at `docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_2026-04-13.json`.
  - added CI enforcement step for performance guardrails in `.github/workflows/platform-guardrails.yml`.
  - added contract list/repository index set with query plan evidence in `docs/QUERY_PLAN_2026-04-13.md`.

## Definition of “Powerful and Complete” for This Repo

This repo reaches CMS Aegis-level enterprise readiness when all of the following are true:
1. No `P0` security/reliability gaps remain open.
2. Contract lifecycle is enforced by state-machine rules, not only UI/form behavior.
3. At least one production-grade e-sign integration and one business-system integration are live.
4. Search includes full-text + metadata + semantic retrieval with tenant-safe access control.
5. Compliance module can produce defensible, tamper-evident audit/export evidence.
6. Platform operations meet SLOs with alerts, drills, and repeatable release gates.
